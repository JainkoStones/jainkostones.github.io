<h1> Transmission 2 </h1>
<p>Those foul of heart that seek power never hold it.</p>
<p>But those pure of heart who do not, suffer.</p>
<p>Balance between greed and altruism matters,</p>
<p>Or one will never truly have peace.</p>
<h1> Transmission 1 </h1>
<p>Ah, it seems you got my package.</p>
<p>I'm sure you know about the Jainko Stones, what power they each posess, and what would happen if someone with ill intent united them.</p>
<p>A group of people with ill intent called E Corp is trying to unite the Jainko Stones for their own ends.</p>
<p>I would find all of them myself, but I'm currently trapped in a computer, thanks to E Corp.</p>
<p> I've given you all the clues, you just need to inspect for yourself.</p>
